			<p>Styling Links is a lot more complicated than it looks. It consists of states which means when and how you press the links and which way the link should reacts.</p>
			<p>One link can have 4 different states, Those Are:</p>
			
			<ol>
			<li>a:link</li>
			<p>When the Link is 1st Visited.</p>
			<li>a:visited</li>
			<p>When the link has been Already Visited.</p>
			<li>a:hover</li>
			<p>As your mouse pointer hover over the link.</p>
			<li>a:active</li>
			<p>As your mouse button is pressed when you're clicking the link.</p>
			</ol>
