			<h3>DIV IDS</h3>
			<p>In the last tutorials we have learnt about div tag which is used for positioning the web elements. since we would be having lots of div tags then it sure be confusing to have control over all of them.</p>
			<p>Div tag has an attribute names as id. which we can assign to div elements and then call that id to implement the customization</p>
			<div id="first">This is First DIV ELEMENT</div>
			<div id="second">This is Second DIV ELEMENT</div>
