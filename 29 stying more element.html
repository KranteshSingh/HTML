			<h1>Attention Grabbing Heading.</h1>	
			<h3>Styling more than one element & Span</h3>
			<p>In this we are going to style element in one go. Earlier we used to style the web element by calling each one of it sequentially.</p>
			<p>For Example I would like to change the text color to red of both the header 3 and paragraph Tag, So What do we do?</p>
			<p>We just have to select the element like we do it earlier and add a comma and write another element.</p>
			
			<h4>What the heck is SPAN</h4>
			<p>When we want to add styling to the <span>selective or group of a web element</span> we use SPAN tag and surround that element via SPAN tag. Span is the keyword that you need to use you can't use any other word.</p>
