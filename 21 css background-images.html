				<h2>Learning CSS</h2>
				<p>This is tutorial about CSS. XHTML Build the structure of the website like adding text, images etc.
				CSS does the designing part of the website like font size font color image style etc etc.
				In the header section of the website we wrote the style statement to add CSS property to our paragraphs.
				XHTML is white space insensitive.</p>
				
				<p>To change the overall text,font style of the web page you need to edit the body element.</p>
				<p>By Default the background image is gonna repeat itself to whole web page. In order to not repeat the websites you need to add a property 'background-repeat:none' in the css.</p>
				
				
				<ul>
					<li>background-repeat:repeat-x;</li>
					<p>This is gonna tile it left to right. in case you need it.</p>
					<li>background-repeat:repeat-y</li>		
					<p>This is gonna tile the image to up to down. in case you need it.</p>
					<li>background-repeat:no-repeat;</li>
					<p>This will make the image not repeat on whole web page</p>
					<li>background-position:10px 60px</li>
					<p>This property will specify the background image position. Wherever you want. 10px will shift the image from left and 60px will shift the image from top. You can also set the value in term of percentage </p>
				</ul>
